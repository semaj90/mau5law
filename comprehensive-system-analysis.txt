THE INTELLIGENT FEEDBACK LOOP:

1. USER INTERACTION PREDICTION
   - HMM tracks user state transitions across 7 legal workflow states:
     * idle → document_loading → document_analysis
     * evidence_review ↔ legal_research ↔ contract_drafting
     * compliance_check → back to analysis cycle
   - SOM clustering creates compact bitmap signatures of user behavior
   - 80%+ prediction confidence achieved through historical learning

2. PROACTIVE ASSET GENERATION
   - Predictive engine forecasts next user actions
   - PageRank system provides authority-weighted document candidates
   - CHR-ROM patterns are pre-generated for predicted user needs
   - Zero-latency UI rendering through proactive caching

3. CONTINUOUS OPTIMIZATION
