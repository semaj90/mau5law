# LEGAL_AI_COMPONENTS_COMPLETE.md

Version: 1.0
Last updated: 2025-09-04

## Purpose
This document collects concise legal, compliance, and usage guidance for AI components used in this project. It is intended to be included with the frontend repository and to inform developers, integrators, and reviewers about obligations and limits when building or deploying AI features.

## Scope
Applies to:
- All AI models, inference code, hosted endpoints, and prompts integrated into this repository.
- Any datasets, training artifacts, or third-party models used directly or indirectly by project components.

## Definitions
- "AI Component": model weights, inference services, prompt templates, and client code that produces or processes model output.
- "Contributor": anyone who adds code, models, or data to the repository.
- "User": end user of the application or model outputs.

## Allowed Use
- Build, test, and ship features that integrate AI components consistent with applicable law and third-party licenses.
- Use open-source models and datasets in compliance with their license terms and attribution requirements.
- Improve safety and privacy by default (e.g., input validation, output filtering).

## Prohibited Use
- Use models or outputs for unlawful activities, harassment, discrimination, or any purpose that violates third-party rights.
- Deploy models in high-risk regulated domains (medical diagnosis, legal advice, critical infrastructure) without explicit domain expert review and appropriate controls.
- Share or publish model weights, datasets, or proprietary code that the project is not licensed to distribute.

## Licensing & Attribution
- Record licenses for each third-party model and dataset used. Include license files or links in the repository.
- Respect attribution or commercial use restrictions (e.g., non-commercial clauses) and enforce those restrictions in deployment decisions.
- If combining incompatible licenses, do not distribute the combined artifact; seek legal review.

## Data Handling & Privacy
- Avoid sending sensitive personal data to third-party inference APIs unless explicitly permitted and secure.
- When collecting or logging model inputs/outputs, apply minimization, anonymization, and retention limits.
- Prepare a data deletion and export process for user data that may be stored or logged by AI components.

## Warranties & Liability
- The project provides AI components "as is" without warranties of accuracy, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
- Do not rely solely on model outputs for safety-critical, legal, medical, or financial decisions. Include explicit disclaimers in UX and documentation where appropriate.

## Safety & Moderation
- Implement content filtering and rate limits for user-provided prompts that could produce harmful outputs.
- Add human review workflows for outputs that could materially affect user rights or safety.
- Log moderation decisions and errors for continuous improvement and auditing.

## Security
- Secure model endpoints with authentication and encrypted transport.
- Limit access to model keys and credentials; rotate secrets on compromise.
- Treat model artifact storage as sensitive â€” apply access controls and backups.

## Compliance & Export Controls
- Confirm models and datasets comply with export control, sanctions, and other jurisdictional restrictions before distribution.
- For deployments across borders, evaluate local data protection and AI-specific regulations.

## Incident Response & Reporting
- Report security incidents, data breaches, or suspected misuse to the project security contact immediately.
- Maintain a record of incidents and remediation steps for audits.

## Contribution Requirements
- When adding models, datasets, or third-party code, include:
    - Source and license metadata.
    - A short security/privacy risk assessment.
    - Any required attribution text and usage constraints.
- PRs that change AI behavior should include test plans and a human-review checklist.

## Disclaimers
- This document is guidance, not legal advice. For contract, regulatory, or high-risk decisions consult legal counsel.
- Keep this file updated as model usage, dependencies, or legal requirements change.

## Contacts
- Repository maintainers: see repository README for names and contact channels.
- Security contact: follow repository CONTRIBUTING.md for reporting instructions.
