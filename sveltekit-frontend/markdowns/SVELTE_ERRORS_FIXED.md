# Svelte Error Fixes Applied

## Fixed Critical Errors

### 1. Modal.svelte Syntax Errors

**Issues Fixed:**

- Line 54: Removed extra quote at the end of `on:keydown` handler
- Line 57: Fixed unterminated `transition:fade` property (added closing `}}`)
- Line 61: Fixed unterminated `transition:fly` property (added closing `}}`)
- Fixed missing closing braces for functions `handleClose()`, `handleKeydown()`, and `handleOutsideClick()`
- Restored proper CSS class names instead of generic "mx-auto px-4 max-w-7xl"

### 2. AuthForm.svelte CSS Issues

**Issues Fixed:**

- Applied correct CSS class names to match the defined styles:
  - `.form-field` for form field containers
  - `.error` for error messages
  - `.form-message` for form messages
  - `.submit-button` for the submit button

## Non-Critical Warnings

### Layout Dark Mode CSS Warnings

The warnings about unused CSS selectors like `[data-theme="dark"] .nav` are expected behavior. These selectors are only active when the theme is set to "dark" mode. They are not errors and are needed for the theme switching functionality.

## Result

All critical syntax errors have been fixed. The application should now compile and run without the JavaScript parse errors. The CSS warnings about dark mode selectors can be safely ignored as they are part of the theme switching feature.
