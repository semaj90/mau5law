# CSS Import Error Fix

## Issue

The application was failing with a file not found error when trying to import Tailwind CSS files:

```
syscall: 'open',
path: 'C:\\Users\\james\\Desktop\\web-app\\sveltekit-frontend\\tailwindcss\\base'
```

## Root Cause

The `src/app.css` file was trying to import Tailwind CSS files directly:

```css
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

However, the project is using **UnoCSS** instead of Tailwind CSS. UnoCSS is a different utility-first CSS framework that is compatible with Tailwind CSS classes but doesn't use the same import mechanism.

## Solution Applied

Removed the Tailwind CSS imports from `src/app.css`, keeping only the UnoCSS reset import:

```css
@import "@unocss/reset/tailwind.css";
```

## Why This Works

1. **UnoCSS** generates utility classes on-demand during the build process
2. It doesn't require importing base/components/utilities files like Tailwind does
3. The `@unocss/reset/tailwind.css` provides the necessary CSS reset styles
4. UnoCSS is properly configured in:
   - `uno.config.ts` - defines the UnoCSS configuration
   - `vite.config.ts` - integrates UnoCSS with Vite
   - `package.json` - includes all necessary UnoCSS dependencies

## Result

The application should now build and run without the file not found error. All utility classes will be generated by UnoCSS as needed.
