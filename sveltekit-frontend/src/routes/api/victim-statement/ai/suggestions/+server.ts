1. **Follow-up Questions:**
   - Can you provide more details about the sequence of events?
   - Were there any witnesses present?
   - Have you reported this to authorities?

2. **Evidence to Consider:**
   - Medical records (if applicable)
   - Communication records
   - Location tracking data

3. **Sensitivity Considerations:**
   - This appears to involve ${statement.emotionalImpact ? 'significant emotional trauma' : 'potential trauma'}
   - Consider involving victim support services

4. **Timeline Verification:**
   - Cross-reference with other case evidence
   - Verify alibi if applicable

Please proceed carefully and consider the victim's well-being throughout the process.`;
