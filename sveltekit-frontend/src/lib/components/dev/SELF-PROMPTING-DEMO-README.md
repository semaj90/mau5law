### Data Flow
1. **Initial Prompt Processing**: User input analyzed and distributed to agents
2. **Semantic Search**: Context7 MCP tools perform relevant document retrieval
3. **Memory Analysis**: Graph-based knowledge retrieval and relationship mapping
4. **Agent Coordination**: Multiple AI agents process different aspects of the task
5. **Self-Prompting**: Meta-analysis generates refined prompts for next iteration
6. **Synthesis**: Results combined into comprehensive analysis and recommendations

## üîÑ Self-Prompting Process

### Phase 1: Analysis
- Agents receive initial prompt and context
- Each agent processes task according to its specialization
- Results include confidence scores and reasoning chains

### Phase 2: Meta-Analysis
- Orchestration system analyzes all agent outputs
- Identifies strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in analysis
- Calculates overall confidence and completion metrics

### Phase 3: Prompt Evolution
- Based on meta-analysis, generates refined prompts
- Focuses on identified weaknesses or unexplored areas
- Maintains context from previous iterations

### Phase 4: Iteration
- Refined prompts distributed to agents for next round
- Process continues until confidence threshold met or max iterations reached
- Each iteration builds upon previous insights
