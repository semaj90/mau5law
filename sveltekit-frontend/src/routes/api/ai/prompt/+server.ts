      `Based on your query about "${prompt}", here are some key legal considerations:

1. **Relevant Statutes**: This case may fall under PC 211 (Robbery) or PC 459 (Burglary) depending on the specific circumstances.

2. **Evidence Requirements**: 
   - Document all physical evidence thoroughly
   - Ensure chain of custody is maintained
   - Collect witness statements promptly

3. **Legal Precedents**: Consider reviewing similar cases from the past 5 years in your jurisdiction.

4. **Procedural Notes**: 
   - Miranda rights must be properly administered
   - Search warrants may be required for certain evidence
   - Time limitations apply for filing charges

**Recommendation**: Review the evidence carefully and consider consulting with the legal department for complex constitutional issues.`,

      `Regarding "${prompt}", the legal analysis suggests:

**Constitutional Considerations:**
- Fourth Amendment protections apply to search and seizure
- Due process requirements must be met throughout

**Statutory Framework:**
- Primary charges may include violations of state penal code
- Federal jurisdiction may apply if interstate commerce involved

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. Prioritize evidence collection and preservation
2. Interview witnesses while memories are fresh
3. Consider plea bargain negotiations if case strength is uncertain
4. Prepare for potential defense arguments

**Timeline Considerations:**
- Statute of limitations varies by charge type
- Speedy trial requirements must be met
- Discovery deadlines are critical`,

      `Analysis of "${prompt}":

**Case Strength Assessment:**
- Evidence appears substantial but requires expert testimony
- Witness credibility will be key factor
- Physical evidence strongly supports prosecution

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate**: Secure all digital evidence
2. **Short-term**: Schedule expert witness consultations
3. **Long-term**: Prepare comprehensive case strategy

**Risk Factors:**
- Defense may challenge evidence admissibility
- Potential constitutional issues with search procedures
- Witness availability concerns

**Success Probability**: Based on current evidence, prosecution has strong foundation but should prepare for vigorous defense.`,
