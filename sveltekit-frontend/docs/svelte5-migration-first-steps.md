# Svelte 5 â€” First steps for migration

This document contains a short, pragmatic checklist to get a SvelteKit project started when migrating to Svelte 5 and to avoid common errors.

## Before you start
- Commit or stash any uncommitted changes.
- Read your app's tests and ensure they run locally.
- Review third-party libraries for Svelte 5 compatibility.

## Quick checklist
1. Update dependencies
   - Update Svelte and related tooling in package.json (run a local test after upgrading).
	 Example:
	 ```bash
	 npm install svelte@latest @sveltejs/kit@latest
	 ```
2. Update your Svelte configuration
   - Check your svelte.config.js or svelte.config.cjs for deprecated options and adapter compatibility with SvelteKit.
3. Replace deprecated APIs
   - Search the codebase for warnings about removed or renamed APIs and adapt to the new equivalents.
4. Test components incrementally
   - Run the dev server and fix compiler errors per-file; start with shared components and routes with many imports.
5. Run linters and tests
   - Fix issues reported by TypeScript, ESLint, or other static tools.

## Common fixes
- If imports fail, ensure paths are correct and update any changed export names.
- If the compiler reports a changed lifecycle or store API, consult the official migration notes for exact replacements.
- For SvelteKit routing changes, update route filenames and the server/client load function signatures as needed.

## Troubleshooting tips
- Start the dev server with verbose output to see full compiler diagnostics:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- When encountering an unfamiliar error, create a minimal reproduction (single-component) to isolate the cause.
- Consult upstream changelogs and migration guides for libraries you depend on.

## Example minimal component change
If a lifecycle name or import changed, update the component like this:
