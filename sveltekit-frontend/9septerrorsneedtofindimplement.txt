Now I'll patch gpu-summary-store.ts to add a safe initWasmRerank helper and a small flag watcher for window._USE_WASM_RERANK. I'll keep it non-invasive.

gpu-summary-store.ts
Checkpoint: Created 5 files (encode +server, decode +server, vector index +server, ambient types d.ts earlier, and directories). Edited gpu-summary-store.ts to add wasm rerank helpers. Next I'll add a small demo page UI patch to the demo +page.svelte to expose toggles and buttons. I'll apply a focused patch near the top where onMount is defined and add UI controls in the markup.

+page.svelte
I'll insert a small UI panel into the page markup (near top of template) with the buttons and checkboxes for the demo controls.

B) Add /api/auth/health reporting adapter status, schema identity booleans, active session count. C) Rename legacy schema.ts to legacy-schema.ts and add a failing export for users/sessions to catch accidental imports.

  Results:
  - Files Fixed: 65+ files across the entire codebase
  - Patterns Addressed: 6 major syntax error patterns
  - Error Reduction: From ~800 TypeScript errors down to ~50 remaining edge     
  cases

  The systematic fix covered:- Core framework files (routing, parsing)-Server infrastructure (auth, cache, monitoring)-State management (stores, machines)
  - Services (AI, orchestration, WebGPU)
  - API routes and schemas

  Now I can proceed with the next priority task: Implementing WebASM 
  inference in vector search workflow. This builds on the GPU summary store     
  I created earlier and will integrate WebAssembly inference capabilities       
  into the vector search pipeline.
Read(sveltekit-frontend\src\lib\stores\gpu-summary-store.svelte.ts)
Perfect! I can see that the GPU summary store already has the foundation      
  for WebASM inference metrics. Now I need to implement the actual WebASM       
  inference integration into the vector search workflow. Let me create the      
  WebASM inference service:
