● Perfect! I can see the RTX-enhanced system startup script is a  
  comprehensive concurrency manager that orchestrates multiple    
  services. However, it looks like it's trying to use zx (Google's
   zx library) but may be missing dependencies. Let me start the  
  Go tensor service to complete your microservice architecture:   


got stuck somewhere, need caddy...a certificate? nginx?
te(~\Desktop\deeds-web\deeds-web-app\go-microservice\tensor-serv        ice\main.go)
  ⎿  Updated ..\go-microservice\tensor-service\main.go with 1
     addition and 1 removal
        8      "os/signal"
        9      "syscall"
       10    
       11 -    pb "github.com/deeds-web/legal-ai/proto"
       11 +    pb "./proto"
       12      "google.golang.org/grpc"
       13      "google.golang.org/grpc/reflection"
       14    )

● Now I need to generate the protobuf Go code. Let me update the      
  todo and generate the proto files:

● Bash(cd /c/Users/james/Desktop/deeds-web/deeds-web-app/go-microservi      ce/tensor-service && protoc --version)
  ⎿  Error: /usr/bin/bash: line 1: protoc: command not found

● I need to create the protobuf Go files manually since protoc        
  isn't installed. L

● Let me try running the migration manually using       
  psql instead of the Node.js script. This will
  bypass any Node.js connection issues:

● Bash(cd /c/Users/james/Desktop/deeds-web/deeds-web-app      /sveltekit-frontend && timeout 60s psql postgresql      ://postgres:123456@localhost:5432/legal_ai_db -f  
      sql/migratio…)
  ⎿  CREATE EXTENSION
     CREATE EXTENSION
     CREATE EXTENSION
     … +119 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Great! The migration is partially working but
  there are schema conflicts - some tables already      
  exist with different column structures. Let me run    
   the migration status check to see what exists:

Answer: There are no symlinks/junctions under organized-files right now.
I verified by scanning for reparse points (symlinks/junctions) under organized-files; count reported: 0.
If you want auto copy/symlink at startup:

We can add a small startup step to aligned-dev-orchestrator.mjs (or a separate PowerShell script) that:
Copies or symlinks selected paths from organized-files/... into sveltekit-frontend/src/... before launching Vite.
Uses a JSON mapping so it’s easy to maintain.

ample mapping idea (not created yet):

scripts/organized-files-map.json
[{ from: "organized-files/svelte-components/sveltekit-frontend_src_lib_components_upload/MinIOUpload.svelte", to: "sveltekit-frontend/src/lib/components/upload/MinIOUpload.svelte", mode: "symlink" }]
Want me to wire this mapping and a pre-step into dev:full so it syncs before Vite starts?
aligned-dev-orchestrator.mjs+87-0
aligned-dev-orchestrator.mjs+3-0
Created organized-files-map.json

Wiring it in now and keeping it safe by default.

What I added

Pre-start sync in aligned-dev-orchestrator.mjs:

Reads organized-files-map.json.
For each entry { from, to, mode }, tries symlink first (junction for directories on Windows), falls back to copy if symlink fails.
Skips when target already exists (no overwrite by default).
Runs before services start so Vite sees files at launch.
Mapping file to opt-in items:

organized-files-map.json (example entry included)
from: organized-files/...
to: sveltekit-frontend/...
mode: "symlink" or omit to allow default symlink-then-copy behavior
How to use

Edit organized-files-map.json and add entries you want synced, e.g.:
{"from":"organized-files/typescript-source/sveltekit-frontend_src_lib_services/minio-neo4j-pgvector-integration.ts", "to":"sveltekit-frontend/src/lib/services/minio-neo4j-pgvector-integration.ts", "mode":"symlink"}
Start as usual:
npm run dev:full
The orchestrator logs the sync results in aligned-orchestrator.log.
Notes

Currently skips overwriting existing targets; if you want “force refresh”, we can add a flag to remove targets first.
Directory symlinks use “junction” on Windows for compatibility; files use regular symlink.
If you don’t want symlinks at all, set mode: "copy" per entry.
Requirements coverage

“Copy/symlink selected files into sveltekit-frontend during startup”: Done.
Keeps default inert until you add mappings
