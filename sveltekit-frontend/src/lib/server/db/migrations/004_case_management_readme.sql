-- Migration note: case management and related tables
-- The comprehensive schema for cases, evidence, timeline, citations,
-- POI relationships and detective insights has been added in migration
-- 003_deploy_enhanced_legal_schema.sql. If you need to re-run or adjust,
-- create a new migration here with a unique prefix (004_...)

-- To apply migrations via drizzle:
--   npx drizzle-kit migrate
-- or if using the project's runner:
--   node src/lib/server/db/migrate.ts

-- If you need a separate migration adding indexes or triggers, create
-- a new .sql file in this folder and include it in the migration runner.
