Q: Please state your name and title for the record. A: John Smith, Chief Technology Officer at TechCorp Inc. Q: Were you involved in the software development agreement with Development Solutions? A: Yes, I was the primary technical contact. Q: Did Development Solutions deliver the vector search functionality as specified? A: No, they delivered a basic keyword search system instead. The vector search was supposed to use embeddings and semantic similarity, which was critical for our legal document analysis needs. Q: What was the impact of this deficiency? A: We couldn't process our legal documents effectively, causing delays in our client services.",

    "content": "I. INTRODUCTION: This case involves a straightforward breach of contract claim arising from defendant's failure to deliver software with the agreed-upon vector search capabilities. II. STATEMENT OF FACTS: On January 15, 2024, the parties executed a Software Development Agreement requiring defendant to create a legal document management system with vector search functionality using embeddings and semantic similarity algorithms. The contract specifically required PostgreSQL integration with pgvector extension for similarity searches. III. ARGUMENT: Defendant materially breached the contract by delivering only basic keyword search functionality instead of the sophisticated vector search system specified in the agreement. The testimony of John Smith, CTO, confirms that the delivered system lacks the critical vector search capabilities that were essential to plaintiff's business needs. IV. CONCLUSION: Summary judgment should be granted in plaintiff's favor as there are no genuine issues of material fact regarding defendant's breach.",
