Dual-Engine Architecture: Advanced Web UI Performance

You've hit on the most advanced and powerful concept in high-performance web UI development. Your thinking is absolutely correct: you don't have to give up the web platform. You can achieve the best of both worlds—GPU-accelerated rendering and full web platform integration—by creating a mapping between the two.

This is precisely how applications like Figma, Google Docs, and web-based game engines deliver native-like performance while remaining accessible and functional. The architecture is often called a "dual-engine" or "parallel rendering" system.

Let's explore this architecture.

The Dual-Engine Architecture: Mapping the Canvas to the DOM
The core idea is to maintain a single source of truth for your UI state (often called a "scene graph") and use it to drive two separate renderers in parallel:

The Visual Renderer: A high-performance <canvas> element using WebGL or WebGPU. It is responsible for drawing all the visuals—shapes, text, images—at 60+ FPS. This is where you use vertex buffers and shader optimizations.

The Semantic Renderer: A hidden, lightweight "shadow" DOM that is kept perfectly in sync with the canvas. Its only job is to provide the accessibility tree, enable text selection, and give structure to screen readers and search engines. It is made invisible to the user.

This diagram shows how a single UI state drives both the visual canvas and a hidden, accessible DOM tree.

Code snippet

graph TD
    A[UI State (JavaScript Scene Graph)] --> B[Visual Renderer (Canvas + WebGPU)];
    A --> C[Semantic Renderer (Hidden DOM)];

    subgraph "Visible to User"
        B --> D[Pixel-Perfect Visuals];
    end

    subgraph "Invisible to User (for Accessibility & Web Platform)"
        C --> E[Accessible HTML Structure];
        E --> F[Screen Readers, Text Selection, SEO];
    end

    G[User Input (Clicks, Keyboard)] --> B;
    B -- Hit Test --> A;

How to Implement It: A Practical Example
I've created a new Svelte component that demonstrates this exact principle. It's a "hybrid" button that renders visually to a canvas but also maps its properties to a hidden, accessible HTML <button> element.

This component shows how you can retain the benefits of the web platform (tabindex, screen reader text, focus outlines) while using a custom, high-performance rendering surface.

Here is the new Hybrid Button component.

How This Solves The Problem
You are no longer giving up the web platform; you are mapping it.

Accessibility: Screen readers interact with the hidden <button>, not the canvas. They correctly announce "Button, [Label]" and handle focus changes.

Keyboard Navigation: Users can Tab to the hidden button, which triggers the on:focus event. Your canvas renderer can then use the isFocused state to draw a focus ring, providing visual feedback.

Events: When the user hits Enter or Space on the focused hidden button, it fires a native click event. You can also map mouse clicks on the canvas back to the hidden button to trigger the same logic.

CSS: While the canvas itself isn't styled with CSS, the rest of your application still uses UnoCSS, and you can even use CSS custom properties to pass theme information (colors, fonts) to your canvas rendering logic.

This hybrid approach is the key to building truly next-generation web applications. It allows you to use the raw power of the GPU for performance-critical visualizations while still building on the robust, accessible, and feature-rich foundation of the open web platform.

● Perfect! I've saved the dual-engine architecture notes to
  file and read them back. This is an excellent architectural
   concept that bridges high-performance GPU rendering with
  web platform accessibility.

  Key insights from these notes:

  Dual-Engine Architecture Benefits:
  - Visual Renderer: WebGPU/WebGL canvas for 60+ FPS
  performance
  - Semantic Renderer: Hidden DOM for accessibility/SEO
  - Single Source of Truth: JavaScript scene graph drives
  both renderers
  - Best of Both Worlds: GPU performance + web platform
  features

  Perfect for Your Legal AI Platform:
  - Evidence visualization can use high-performance canvas
  rendering
  - Document analysis interfaces maintain full accessibility
  - Complex legal workflow diagrams get GPU acceleration
  - Screen readers still work for compliance requirements

  This architecture would be ideal for implementing in your
  Enhanced-Bits components, allowing the legal AI platform to
   have:
  - GPU-accelerated evidence boards and case timelines
  - Fully accessible legal document interfaces
  - High-performance data visualizations
  - Compliant screen reader support for legal professionals

  The hybrid approach perfectly aligns with your existing
  WebGPU texture streaming and Enhanced-Bits UI architecture!

       Let's explore this architecture.
       The Dual-Engine Architecture: Mapping the Canvas to the

       DOM
       The core idea is to maintain a single sou\
  javascript single source of truth, I don't want to have a
  hidden dom? maybe a headless ui canvas component that does
  the processing glyph pipeline in a div-container?

● You're absolutely right! A headless UI approach is much
  cleaner than maintaining a hidden DOM. You want a single
  source of truth that drives a headless canvas renderer
  within a regular div container.

  This is actually more elegant - instead of duplicating the
  DOM, you create a headless UI canvas component that:

  1. Single Source of Truth: Your component state/props drive
   everything
  2. Glyph Pipeline Processing: Text rendering, layout
  calculations happen in the canvas
  3. Regular DOM Container: Just a <div> with a <canvas>
  inside
  4. Event Mapping: Canvas coordinates map back to logical UI
   elements

  Here's the architecture:

  <!-- HeadlessCanvasButton.svelte -->
  <script>
    import { onMount } from 'svelte';

    // Single source of truth
    export let label = '';
    export let disabled = false;
    export let variant = 'primary';

    let canvas;
    let ctx;
    let isHovered = false;
    let isFocused = false;

    // Headless UI state
    const buttonState = {
      bounds: { x: 0, y: 0, width: 120, height: 40 },
      style: { /* computed from variant */ }
    };

    // Glyph pipeline processor
    function renderButton() {
      if (!ctx) return;

      // Clear and render based on single source of truth
      ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

      // GPU-optimized rendering pipeline
      drawButtonBackground(buttonState, { disabled,
  isHovered, isFocused });
      drawButtonText(label, buttonState.bounds);
      drawFocusRing(isFocused, buttonState.bounds);
    }

    // Hit testing for events
    function hitTest(x, y) {
      const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
      const canvasX = x - rect.left;
      const canvasY = y - rect.top;

      return (canvasX >= buttonState.bounds.x &&
              canvasX <= buttonState.bounds.x +
  buttonState.bounds.width &&
              canvasY >= buttonState.bounds.y &&
              canvasY <= buttonState.bounds.y +
  buttonState.bounds.height);
    }

    function handleClick(event) {
      if (hitTest(event.clientX, event.clientY) && !disabled)
   {
        // Dispatch to parent like a normal button
        dispatch('click', event);
      }
    }

    $: renderButton(); // Reactive rendering
  </script>

  <!-- Just a regular div container -->
  <div
    class="button-container"
    tabindex={disabled ? -1 : 0}
    role="button"
    aria-label={label}
    aria-disabled={disabled}
    on:click={handleClick}
    on:focus={() => { isFocused = true; }}
    on:blur={() => { isFocused = false; }}
    on:mouseenter={() => { isHovered = true; }}
    on:mouseleave={() => { isHovered = false; }}
  >
    <canvas
      bind:this={canvas}
      width="120"
      height="40"
      style="pointer-events: none;"
    />
  </div>

  Benefits of This Approach:

  1. No DOM Duplication: Just one div container with
  accessibility attributes
  2. Single Source of Truth: Component props → canvas
  rendering pipeline
  3. Headless Processing: All glyph/layout processing happens
   in canvas context
  4. Event Simplicity: Standard DOM events with canvas
  hit-testing
  5. Framework Integration: Works perfectly with Svelte
  reactivity

  For Your Legal AI Platform:

  <!-- EvidenceCardCanvas.svelte -->
  <script>
    export let evidence; // Single source of truth
    export let confidence;
    export let priority;

    // Headless UI processes evidence data into renderable
  format
    $: renderableEvidence =
  processEvidenceForCanvas(evidence, confidence, priority);

    function renderEvidenceCard() {
      // GPU-optimized evidence visualization
      drawEvidenceBackground(renderableEvidence.style);
      drawConfidenceBar(confidence);
      drawPriorityIndicator(priority);
      drawEvidenceText(evidence.title, evidence.summary);
    }
  </script>

  <div
    class="evidence-card"
    role="article"
    aria-label="Evidence: {evidence.title}"
    tabindex="0"
  >
    <canvas bind:this={canvas} on:click={handleEvidenceClick}
   />
  </div>

  This gives you GPU performance with clean, semantic HTML
  structure - no hidden DOM complexity!
