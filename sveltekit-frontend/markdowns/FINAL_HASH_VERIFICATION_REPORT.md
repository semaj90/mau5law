Technical Implementation Details

Database Schema

```sql
-- Evidence table (enhanced)
ALTER TABLE evidence ADD COLUMN hash VARCHAR(64);

-- Hash verifications table (new)
CREATE TABLE hash_verifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  evidence_id UUID REFERENCES evidence(id),
  verified_hash VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
  stored_hash VARCHAR(64),
  result BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  verification_method VARCHAR(50),
  verified_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  notes TEXT,
  verified_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
