   - Missing closing div tags in evidence cards section
   - Template structure needs completion

2. **Incomplete Sections**:
   - Evidence cards grid partially implemented
   - AI analysis display needs gaming theme integration
   - Upload progress indicators need retro styling

#### **Current State Breakdown**:

**✅ Completed Sections**:
- Script setup with all state management (lines 1-100)
- Service health checks with MinIO integration (lines 85-110)
- Enhanced upload function with MinIO support (lines 270-290)
- NES×YoRHa hybrid header with gaming controls (lines 540-600)
- Gaming-style search panel with bucket selection (lines 620-750)

**🔄 Partially Complete**:
- Evidence card structure started but needs completion
- Gaming-themed empty states implemented
- Upload progress tracking configured

**❌ Still Needs Work**:
- Evidence cards display & interaction
- AI analysis results modal with gaming theme
- Upload progress animations with retro effects
- Style definitions for gaming classes
